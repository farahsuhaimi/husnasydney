   <p>Hi Husna! When you are reading this, I might or might not be there with you at the airport. Whatever the situation is there, I hope you are all ready for the degree life overseas and far from home. 
      Husna, our friendship started off weird because we did not have other things to speak about other than mamat tu. But as time goes by, I actually realise that we have a lot in common. I am 
	  always amazed by you texting me about the most random thing I could ever think of. Like you saw a meme, a kpop mv or kdramas. As I think of it now, it's actually nice having you messaging me those 
	  things. You buat I terharu sebab you think of me bila nak text semua benda tu. So please after you dekat Sydney pun, tell me all those little things that happens there. I don't care how random
	  benda tu, I will always listen to your story. Tolong carikan I mamat aussie satu (Jake). Nanti bila dah sampai sana, jangan lupa to take pictures banyak-banyak and send it to me tau.
	  Yang paling penting sekali your picture la! Please amik your picture kat sana, update me every week okie! Also if you nak rant about anything, just bagitau tau.
	  My bb, I really want to see you succeed in this life and to see you finally escape from little challenges that stops you here. 
	  I appreciate you for being my friend and sebab stay here since 2019. Thank you sebab selalu dengar I rant pasal studies and pasal Adli before ni. I doakan your 
	  daily basis there and studies terjaga kat sana.  Hehe btw, I'm sorry this is all the gift I sempat prepare untuk you. Nanti you balik, kita pergi makan lah!
	  I am wishing you all the happiness and success cause you deserve it so much bb <3. Remember you will always have me, no matter the distance.
	  I am always gonna be one text away just like always. Take care Husna till we meet again.
	  <br> <br>
	  With love and heartfelt wishes,
       <br>
      [Farah Jake]
